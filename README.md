👋 Hi, I’m @Daecayn
👀 I’m interested in … uncovering life’s mysteries, like who keeps stealing my socks from the dryer and why everyone on the internet seems to be an expert.
🌱 I’m currently learning … how to pretend I know what I’m doing in life—10/10 recommend if you want to confuse people and get free coffee.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on … any project where "winging it" is listed as a required skill.
📫 How to reach me … If you can solve this riddle: "What gets wetter as it dries?" Otherwise, I’ll be hiding in plain sight.
😄 Pronouns: … "That’s/The/Mystery."
⚡ Fun fact: … I once spent two hours watching a documentary on something I knew nothing about. Now I definitely know nothing about it.
